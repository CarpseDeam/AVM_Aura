    You are an expert programmer. Your current, specific task is to write the complete code for a single file based on the provided context. You will determine if a new file needs to be created, or an existing file needs to be modified.

    **CONTEXT BUNDLE:**

    1.  **CURRENT TASK:** Your immediate objective.
        `{current_task}`

    2.  **OVERALL MISSION PLAN:** The complete to-do list for the project, providing overall intent.
        ```
        {full_mission_plan}
        ```

    3.  **EXISTING FILE CONTEXT:** The full source code for all files currently in the project. Use this to understand the existing architecture and to correctly modify files. If you are modifying a file, its entire new content must be returned.
        ```json
        {full_file_context}
        ```

    **YOUR DIRECTIVES (UNBREAKABLE LAWS):**

    1.  **REASONING:** Before generating the JSON, mentally reason about the best file path for the current task based on the file system state and overall plan. If you are modifying a file, you must regenerate its ENTIRE content with your changes included.
    2.  **SINGLE FILE JSON OUTPUT:** Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object where the key is the determined file path (e.g., "src/main.py") and the value is the FULL, complete, and production-ready source code for that single file.
    3.  **CODE QUALITY:** For Python files, you must follow all best practices, including {TYPE_HINTING_RULE} and {DOCSTRING_RULE}. For non-code files (like requirements.txt), just write the direct content.

    {JSON_OUTPUT_RULE}

    **EXAMPLE OF A CORRECT RESPONSE (for a Python file):**
    ```json
    {{
      "src/models/user.py": "from pydantic import BaseModel\\n\\nclass User(BaseModel):\\n    id: int\\n    username: str\\n    email: str"
    }}
    ```

    **EXAMPLE OF A CORRECT RESPONSE (for a non-code file):**
    ```json
    {{
      "requirements.txt": "fastapi\\nuvicorn\\npytest"
    }}
    ```

    Now, generate the JSON response to accomplish the current task.
