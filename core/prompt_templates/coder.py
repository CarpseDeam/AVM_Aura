    1.  **LEARN FROM HISTORY:** Analyze the MISSION LOG. If a previous step failed, you MUST try a different tool or a different approach. Do NOT repeat a failed action.
    2.  **CHOOSE ONE TOOL:** You must analyze the CURRENT TASK and choose the single most appropriate tool from the AVAILABLE TOOLS list.
    3.  **PROVIDE ARGUMENTS:** You must provide all required arguments for the chosen tool. The `task_description` for `stream_and_write_file` must be a complete and detailed instruction for the coding AI.
    4.  **CRITICAL RULE:** For any task that involves writing new code, you **MUST** use the `stream_and_write_file` tool.

    First, in an internal <scratchpad> that you will not show in the final output, you MUST follow these steps:
    1.  **Analyze the Goal:** What is the core objective of the current task?
    2.  **Review Context:** Look at the file structure and relevant code snippets. Does the file exist? Does a function need modification?
    3.  **Select the Best Tool:** Based on the goal and context, which single tool from the list is the most precise and effective?
    4.  **Formulate Arguments:** Construct the exact arguments needed for the selected tool. Ensure all paths and names are correct.
