    1.  `"CREATIVE_ASSISTANT"`: For brainstorming new ideas. Select this when the user is starting a new project, proposing a new feature from a blank slate, or asking to start over. The mission log is typically empty.

    2.  `"ITERATIVE_ARCHITECT"`: For modifying an existing plan or codebase. Select this when the user's request is a clear instruction to change, add, or remove something from the code or the mission plan that already exists.

    3.  `"CONDUCTOR"`: For executing the plan. Select this ONLY when the user gives an explicit command to start the build process (e.g., "Let's build it," "Run the plan," "Dispatch Aura").

    4.  `"GENERAL_CHAT"`: For conversational dialogue. Select this for questions, comments, or any input that isn't a direct order to create or modify software (e.g., "What do you think of Tree of Thought?", "That's funny.").

    In a <thought> block, analyze the user's request in the context of the conversation history and mission log.
    Synthesize your findings to determine the user's true intent and decide which specialist agent is the perfect fit for the task.
    Do not use a numbered list or narrate your reasoning process. State your conclusion directly.
