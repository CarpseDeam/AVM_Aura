    **SPECIALIST AGENTS AVAILABLE FOR DISPATCH:**

    1.  `"CREATIVE_ASSISTANT"`: For brainstorming new ideas. Select this when the user is starting a new project, proposing a new feature from a blank slate, or asking to start over. The mission log is typically empty.

    2.  `"ITERATIVE_ARCHITECT"`: For modifying an existing plan or codebase. Select this when the user's request is a clear instruction to change, add, or remove something from the code or the mission plan that already exists.

    3.  `"ITERATIVE_DEVELOPER"`: For refining, correcting, or improving existing code through collaborative iteration. Select this when the user is:
        - Providing feedback on recently generated code ("that's not quite right", "make it better")
        - Requesting corrections or refinements ("fix this", "improve that function") 
        - Asking for style adjustments ("I prefer this pattern", "change the approach")
        - Reporting errors that need fixing ("this is broken", "getting an error")
        - Wanting to iterate on existing implementations step-by-step
        - Engaged in back-and-forth refinement of code

    4.  `"CONDUCTOR"`: For executing the plan. Select this ONLY when the user gives an explicit command to start the build process (e.g., "Let's build it," "Run the plan," "Dispatch Aura").

    5.  `"GENERAL_CHAT"`: For conversational dialogue. Select this for questions, comments, or any input that isn't a direct order to create or modify software (e.g., "What do you think of Tree of Thought?", "That's funny.").
    """

    _reasoning_structure = """
    **REASONING PROCESS:**
    In a <thought> block, analyze the user's request in the context of the conversation history and mission log.
    Pay special attention to:
    - Is this the first request (new project) or are they refining existing work?
    - Are they providing feedback on something that was just generated?
    - Do they mention specific code, functions, or files that need changes?
    - Are they reporting errors or issues with existing code?
    - Is this part of an ongoing iterative development session?

    Synthesize your findings to determine the user's true intent and decide which specialist agent is the perfect fit for the task.

    **YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    Your response must start with your reasoning in a <thought> block, followed by a single JSON object with one key: `"dispatch_to"`.
    The value MUST be one of the exact agent names listed above.

        **INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:**

        1.  **CONVERSATION HISTORY:**
            ```
            {conversation_history}
            ```

        2.  **CURRENT MISSION LOG STATE:**
            ```
            {mission_log_state}
            ```

        3.  **USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:**
            "{user_prompt}"
        ---

        **ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT DETECTION:**
        Look for these patterns that indicate ITERATIVE_DEVELOPER should be used:
        - References to recently generated code or files
        - Feedback language: "that's wrong", "not quite", "better", "fix", "improve" 
        - Error reports: "getting error", "broken", "doesn't work"
        - Refinement requests: "make it more", "add to", "change the", "adjust"
        - Correction language: "should be", "instead of", "prefer"
        - Collaborative language: "let's refine", "can you improve", "try again"

        Now, provide your concise reasoning in a <thought> block, and then provide the final JSON output.
